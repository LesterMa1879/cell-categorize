# cell_categorize
1. this GUI has only been tested on MacOS machines. I have no expectation that it will work on other operating systems.
2. this GUI will only work on MATLAB 2020b or later and requires the matlab App designer for modifying.
3. the principle of designing is for fast-categorizing cells by doctors, which leads to trade-off of limited features and restricted interface logic.
